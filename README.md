Sentry-Image is an open-source project for detecting AI-generated contents. The core features will include:
* The weights, training code and evaluation code for state-of-the-art AI-generated contents detection models.
* The training, validation and test [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InfImagine/FakeImageDataset) for [Sentry-Image Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/).

Why we need Sentry-Image?
* üßê Recent [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13023) have shown that humans struggle significantly to distinguish real photos from AI-generated ones, with a misclassification rate of **38.7%**.

* ü§ó To help people confirm whether the images they see are real images or AI-generated images, we launched the Sentry-Image project.

* üíª Sentry-Image is an open source project which provides the SOTA fake image detection models in [Sentry-Image Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/) to detect whether the image provided is an AI-generated or real image.

Stay tuned for this project! Feel free to contact [contact@infimagine.com](contact@infimagine.com)! üòÜ 

## News
* [2023/07] We open source the [Sentry-Image repository](https://github.com/Inf-imagine/Sentry) and [Sentry-Image Demo & Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/). 
* [2023/07] We open source the [Sentry-Image dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InfImagine/FakeImageDataset). 

## Install

## Model Weights

## Fake Image Dataset
Fake Image Dataset is now open-sourced at [huggingface (InfImagine Organization)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InfImagine/FakeImageDataset/tree/main/ImageData/train). ‚Üó It consists of two folders, *ImageData* and *MetaData*. *ImageData* contains the compressed packages of the Fake Image Dataset, while *MetaData* contains the labeling information of the corresponding data indicating whether they are real or fake.
### How to Download
```shell
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/InfImagine/FakeImageDataset
```

## TODO
- [x] Release the training, validation datasets from MPBench.
- [ ] Release the test datasets from Sentry-Image Leaderboard.
- [ ] Release the training and evaluation code of Sentry-Image.
