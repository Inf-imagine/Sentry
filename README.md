Sentry-Image is an open-source library for detecting AI-generated contents. The core features will include:
* The weights, training code and evaluation code for state-of-the-art AI-generated contents detection models.
* The training, validation and test datasets for [Sentry-Image Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/).

## News
* [2023/07] We open source the [Sentry-Image repository](https://github.com/Inf-imagine/Sentry) and [Sentry-Image Demo & Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/).
