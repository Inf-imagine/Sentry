Sentry-Image is an open-source project for detecting AI-generated contents. The core features will include:
* The weights, training code and evaluation code for state-of-the-art AI-generated contents detection models.
* The training, validation and test datasets for [Sentry-Image Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/).

Why we need Sentry-Image?
* üßê Recent [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13023) have shown that humans struggle significantly to distinguish real photos from AI-generated ones, with a misclassification rate of **38.7%**.

* ü§ó To help people confirm whether the images they see are real images or AI-generated images, we launched the Sentry-Image project.

* üíª Sentry-Image is an open source project which provides the SOTA fake image detection models in [Sentry-Image Leaderboard](http://sentry.infimagine.com/) to detect whether the image provided is an AI-generated or real image.

Stay tuned for this project! Feel free to contact [contact@infimagine.com](contact@infimagine.com)! üòÜ
